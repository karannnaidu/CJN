            <p class="heading-primary-sub-3">
                CJN Properties was founded by <b> Late Shri C. Jagannath Naidu.</b> Originally hailing from Pallikonda,
                a small border town in Tamil Nadu.
            </p>
            <p class="heading-primary-sub-3">

                In the year 1966 he moved to Bengaluru, as a young man aspiring for better opportunities in
                life. He did get a wonderful opportunity in the form of an employment with the Indian Telephone
                Industries Ltd (ITI) serving the organisation for <b> 40 long years.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="heading-primary-sub-3">
                While in service, his entrepreneurial desires had allowed him to try his hand at various
                business opportunities. He did find success and the enterprising activities also allowed him to
                gain good business knowledge and wide circle of contacts.
            </p>
            <p class="heading-primary-sub-3">
                He joined hands with his friends and developed lands  <b>creating Sathya Sai Layout </b>, Whitefield,
                Bengaluru and Pai Layout in Ramamurthy Nagar, Bengaluru.
            </p>

            <p class="heading-primary-sub-3">
                A very special credit bestows on him for having not just developed lands, but also to have sold
                the plots on instalments. It happened to be so as he had understood the difficulties of workmen
                having been himself in employment. He therefore came up with the instalment schemes that allowed
                the employees of ITI and other factories to benefit from this yeoman offer rendered by  <b>Late Shri
                C. Jagannath Naidu </b> to own a piece of land in Bengaluru.

                    after my first deposit before I got possession of the flat. There were no hidden costs nor
                    escalation. Everything promised has been delivered including the Amenity block, STP etc.
                    The standard of construction has been good and we have had no major hiccups on this issue.

                    If you intend purchasing a flat, I would recommend CJN for a hassle-free experience.”

                    Honestly, I was impressed with the quality and standards of the materials used and the
                    Developer had actually provided more than what is provided in the agreement. They were also
                    very particular in timely handing over the possession of the flat and no hidden costs.
                    Inspired by the quality of materials used and the fair dealings of the Developer and most
                    competitive rates, I purchased another 2 flats in CJN SAI ENCLAVE, which also stood up to
                    the standards and specifications provided. I am sure at the rates being quoted by them and
                    of the same quality and specifications, one certainly cannot find a better option other than

                    “It’s very good experience purchasing flats from CJN GROUP. Commitment, Quality, Service are
                    very good. On time hand over.
                    As a flat owner we may/ may not satisfy all the requirement but still CJN tries its best to
                    deliver.
                    CJN PROMOTORS are accessible to answer your queries.
                    All the best for your future and ongoing projects.”

                    Enclave, a better testament may be offered by letting you know the reaction of my guests.
                    Every person who has had the opportunity to visit the house has made multiple mention of the
                    remarkable details and finish work. Each time I am able to see this type of reaction it
                    reinforces my pleasure in having chosen your project CJN.
                    I would like to express sincere appreciation for each of your efforts like meeting the
                    project deadlines, understanding our requirements etc.

                    This home has turned out to be more than I had hoped and that is largely attributable to the
                    passion of CJN builders. Thank you once again.”
